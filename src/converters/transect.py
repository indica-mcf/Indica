class TransectCoordinates(CoordinateTransform):
    """Coordinate system for measurements taken along a 1-D line through
    the Tokamak.

    The first spatial position corresponds to an arbitrary index along
    the length of the transect. The second is the vertical offset from
    the transect. Typically, all data will fall directly on the
    transect, but it is useful to have the second coordinate so that
    the system is general and to allow conversions to other systems.

    The coordinates along the transect are the indices of the
    positions provided when intialisign the object.

    The default grid for coordinate transforms in this system is a 1-D
    array corresponding to the positions along the axis specified in
    the parmeters used to intialise the object.

    The implementation currently makes use of interpolation, so that
    it is completely general for nonuniformly spaced points and even
    for a curved line (although the latter would be only
    approximated). However, this has some computational overhead, so
    it may be changed in future.

    Parameters
    ----------
    R_positions
        1-D array of major radii of locations along the transect.
    z_positions
        1-D array of vertical position of locations along the transect.
