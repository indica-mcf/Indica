!	This File containing the necessary Information for producing the 
!	Theoretical Spectrum, for Fit programm. 
!	
!	There are two kind of Information
!
!	The Information about sattelites is Produced from AUTOSTRUCTURE / N. Badnell/.
!	
!	These satt were calculated by A. Marchuk at 2003, Februar, Juelich.
!	
!	Another Information, the effective (excitation , recombination and  inner schell excitation) rate
!	are supplied from another Files., described below.
!      
!	The information qbout He - Lines:	 W,X,Y,and Z calculated by ATOM
!	The information about collisional part of sattelites calculated from Dubau, (Urnov and Goryeav)

!******************************************************************
$Max Ar for all lines(*e13), i.e. Max Width
14.1
!
!Central Line Position(Angstroms)
!Natural Line Width(E13  1/s  ); Del=Ar+Aa; Ar - radiative width= probability of radiative decay;
!				Aa - autoionisation width = probability of autoionisation decay. 
!
!Wavelengths Corresponding to direct excitation
! The wavelength of W = 3.9492 is taken from ATOM calculations, the wavelength of all other 3 lines is taken
! from calculations by Drake, the difference between w of Drake and Atom is taken.
