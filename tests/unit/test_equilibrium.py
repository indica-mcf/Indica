"""Test calculations using equilibrium data."""

# Check R_lfs and R_hfs actually on low/high-flux surfaces and have appropriate
# flux surface values

# Check spatial/flux coord routines are inversions

# Check convert_flux_coords can invert appropriately

# Check intermediate conversions don't affect final result

# Check Btot and minor rad using some sort of dummy data (e.g., some factor
# times distance from magnetic axis?)

# Test use of offset picker

# Check provenance is correct
