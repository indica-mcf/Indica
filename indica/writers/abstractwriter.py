        This is a wrapper function which performs tasks commons to all
        writer classes, such as converting the xarray data structures
        into a form ammenable to output. It will create a new
        :py:class:`xarray.Dataset` containing all data, with
        attributes reformated as necessary:

        - Uncertainty will be made a member of the dataset, with the name
          ``VARIABLE_uncertainty``, where ``VARIABLE`` is the name of the
          variable it is associated with.
        - Dropped data will be merged into the main data and the attribute will
          be replaced with a list of the indices of the dropped channels and
          ``dropped_dim``, the name of the dimension these indices are for.
        - The coordinate transform will be replaced with a JSON serialisation,
          from which it can be recreated. These serialisations will be stored
          in a dictionary attribute for the Dataset as a whole, with each
          DataArray holding the key for its corresponding transform.
        - Datatypes will be serialised as JSON
        - All data will have an ``equilibrium`` attribute, which provides an
          identifier for the equilibrium data (passed to the low-level writer
          in a dictionary).

        Parameters
        ----------
        uid
            User ID (i.e., user that created or wrote this data)
        name

            The data to be written out. The data will be written as though it
