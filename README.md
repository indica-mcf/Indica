InDiCA (**In**tegrated **Di**agnostic **C**omposition **A**nalysis) is
a tool which allows a large number of different diagnostics to be
combined to calculate a self-consistent composition of the plasma
within a Tokamak. Initially it will consist only of a library of
functions, but in time it will include a graphical user interface
(GUI) as well. This is a rewrite of the IDL program WSX.

Currently the library is under active development. The overall design
work has been finished and tests are now being written to define its
detailed behaviour. Functionality will be implemented over the coming
months. In addition to the (rapidly changing) code, this repository
holds the documentation for this project, [which can be read
here](http://cmacmack.gitpages.ccfe.ac.uk/impurities).
