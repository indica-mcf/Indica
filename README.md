InDiCA (**In**tegrated **Di**agnostic **C**omposition **A**nalysis) is
a tool which allows a large number of different diagnostics to be
combined to calculate a self-consistent composition of the plasma
within a Tokamak. Initially it will consist only of a library of
functions, but in time it will include a graphical user interface
(GUI) as well.

Currently the library is under active development. The overall design
work has been finished and functionality is being implemented. In
addition to the (rapidly changing) code, this repository holds the
documentation for this project, [which can be found on
ReadTheDocs](https://indica-ukaea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
