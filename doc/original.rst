Code concept
--------------

The concepts behind the code are thoroughly explained in the cited references, but it is useful to summarize here the main assumptions and features:

* The SXR diode diagnostic is the main tool and starting point for the analysis
* The shape of the SXR emissivity profile is dominated by one high-Z impurity (Z0)
* An independent measurement (VUV) of the concentration of the main impurity (Z0) is used to re-scale the first guess of its density (optional)
* A Zeff measurement is used to calculate the concentration of a low-Z impurity (Z1)
* A second low-Z impurity (Z2) with concentration constant in time can be included
* Bolometer measurements (LoS-integrals and tomographic reconstructions) are used to cross-check the results and define extrapolation limits beyond the limit of applicability determined by the SXR diagnostic filter function
* Toroidal rotation measurements or the mode frequency of MHD modes are used to cross-check the poloidal asymmetry of the main high-Z impurity assuming it is governed by centrifugal asymmetries
* A second high-Z impurity (Z3) can be included, with time evolution identical to Z0, but with scaled peaking following simplified neoclassical theory, asymmetry assuming centrifugal effects and scaled of a fixed multiplication factor for the whole time-range of analysis
* Calculation of the impurity transport coefficients of the main impurity Z0 using the Gradient-Flux relation on sawtooth cycles.
* Correlation with MHD activity is performed by analysing:

    * MHD toroidal mode numbers and mode amplitude of core MHD using toroidal magnetic sensors
    * Sawtooth inversion radius and ICRH resonance layer(s)
    * 2D reconstruction of the electron temperature from ECE rotational tomography
    * Profiles of oscillation amplitude and phase of SXR channels due to MHD activity

The inclusion of multiple impurities is performed in a stepwise fashion:

1.	First guess of Z0 re-scaled to the VUV concentration measurement 
2.	Inclusion of Z1 using Zeff
3.	Calculation of main ion density from quasi-neutrality
4.	Re-estimation of Z0 using Z1 and main ion contributions to SXR (changes mainly the shape, not much the absolute value because of the rescaling to the VUV Z0 concentration measurement)
5.	Consistency-check of:

 	a.	Final estimate of low-Z makes sense (e.g. 10% of Be is way off…)
	b.	Z0 density asymmetry vs. toroidal rotation or MHD mode frequency
	c.	Total radiated power (Z0 + Z1 + main ion) vs. LoS-integrals of bolometry

6.	If rotation estimate is wrong, start over with different main impurity Z0 
7.	If shape of LoS-integrals of bolometry misses features on the LFS-midplane, extrapolate to fit the shape
8.	If missing total radiated power and/or HFS, top/bottom radiation, add Z3 to fill in the gaps
9.	Perform consistency checks again…

Workflow
----------------
In this section, the steps of code execution are outlined in detail. The names used here are JET-specific, but the concept will be exactly the same on other fusion devices, whether they are Tokamaks or Stellaroators.

1. **JPN, tr, dt** : choose pulse # (JPN) to analyse, time-range of interest (tr) and time resolution (dt = typically 10-50 ms) for analysis.

2. Create reference time axis **t_unfold** with desired resolution dt in range tr.
	
3. **Equilibrium UID and DDA** : define equilibrium diagnostic and read diagnostic-independent geometric quantities often used throughout the code (DTYPES details given in section :ref:`dtype`):

	* **rho(nx)**: define reference time-independent normalized radial coordinate array (currently rho-poloidal, radial resolution nx=101 points)
	* **R_2D(nx_Rz), z_2D(nx_Rz)**: define time-independent R and z arrays for mapping quantities in 2D on the poloidal plane (currently spatial resolution nRz = 100)
	* **t_eq(nt_eq)**: read time axis of equilibrium PPF, restrict to chosen time-range tr.
	* **Br(R, z_ax, t_eq), Bz(R, z_ax, t_eq), Bt(R, z_ax, t_eq)**: read magnetic field components on the midplane (from the HFS to the LFS), remap on reference rho
	* **B_tot**: calculate total magnetic field from its components (above)
	* **R_ax(t_eq), z_ax(t_eq)** read magnetic axis position
	* **R_sep(nx_sep, t_eq), z_sep(nx_sep, nt_eq)**: read separatrix position(current spatial resolution nx_sep = 150 points)
	* **R_LFS(rho, ϑ=0, t_eq), R_HFS(rho, ϑ=π, t_eq)**: calculate major radii on LFS & HFS midplane (at z=z_ax) on the reference rho
	* **min_rad_LFS(rho, ϑ=0, t_eq), min_rad_HFS(rho, ϑ=π, t_eq)**: calculate minor radii on the LFS & HFS midplane (z=z_ax) on the reference rho
	* **Vol(rho, t_eq)**: read the plasma volume on the reference rho

4. **Check equilibrium** : for H-mode discharges check that Te at separatrix ~ 100 eV

	* **Read raw HRTS Te(R_hrts, t_hrts)**
	* **Map all measurement positions to reference rho for a set of different R-shifts** for all time-points (currently R_shift = [0, 4.0] cm, dR=0.5 cm, time-independent).
	* **Spline-fit Te** for each R_shift, for each time-point
	* **Find best R-shift** to get Te ~ 100 eV at separatrix for each time-point
	* **Save best R_shift** for remapping of **all diagnostics** used in the analysis

5. **Read SXR data**: user to decide which cameras/diagnostics to read:
	
	* **Read raw data** for all channels
	* **Downsample** to reference time axis t_unfold
	* **Choose which channels to keep** (*some channels may be faulty and should be discarded from the start*)

	*All other diagnostics are currently read later on before commencing the calculation of the impourity density (step 7.). They could also be read at this stage, but should anuwau be read using a common diagnostic-reading-GUI, callable anytime in order to change the data used for the computation or DDA names if specific data is not of good quality. Below is a list of all other physical quantities and respective diagnostics currently included in the computation:*
	
	* **Total radiation**: KB5 
	* **Radiation tomographic reconstructions**: BOLT, B5NN, B5ML, B5MF, ... 
	* **Electron density**: HRTS, LIDR, KG10, ...
	* **Electron temperature**: HRTS, LIDR, KK3, ...
	* **Ion temperature**: CXRS, ...
	* **Toroidal rotation**: CXRS, ...
	* **Impurity concentration and effective charge (passive spectroscopy)**: KT7/3, KX1, KS6, CXRS, KS3, ...
	
	*For all diagnostics, the reading steps are similar, with slight differences if measurements are LOS-integrals or local:*
		
	* LOS-integrals (SXR, Bolometry, passive spectroscopy, ...):
	
		* Read data
		* Downsample / interpolate to t_unfold if diagnostic has higher / lower time-resolution
		* Map LOS coordinate arrays (R,z) to normalized radial coordinate type chosen for reference rho
		* Choose which channels to keep (discard channels that are faulty or viewing the divertor for Bolometry)
		
	* Local measurements (everything else, ...):
	
		* Read data
		* Interpolate on t_unfold if diagnostic has higher time-resolution
		* Map measurement positions (R,z) to normalized radial coordinate type chosen for reference rho
		* Choose which channels to keep 
		* Spline-fit on reference rho
		* Interpolate on t_unfold if diagnostic has lower time-resolution
	
6. **Unfold SXR lines-of-sight** to generate a 2D poloidal map of local emissivities. Depending on the symmetry/asymmetry of the radiation patterns, two different routes are used (*The same methodologies can be applied to the Bolometry diagnostic avoiding LOS viewing the divertor. The functionality of using Bolometry instead of SXR as main driving diagnostic should be added to the new version of the code*):

	* **Symmety**: perform a simple **Abel inversion** of all available LOS
	* **Asymmetry**:
		a) Perform **Abel inversion** of a specified set of lines of sight of one camera (HFS viewing LOS of camera V)
		b) **Fit all LOS using equation 1** of | `M. Sertoli et al. Review of Scientific Instruments 89, 113501 (2018) <https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5046562>`_ searching for the best profiles of **ϵ_SXR(ρ,R_0;t)** and **λ_SXR(ρ;t)**. The local emissivity calculated in a) is used as starting point for ϵ_SXR, while λ_SXR is set to zero across the full radius. Quite strict boundery conditions for ϵ_SXR and λ_SXR are specified to avoid problems in the plasma centre and at the boundary (rho = 1) and radial smoothing is performed to avoid excessive gradients. **The number of knots** for ϵ_SXR and λ_SXR is chosen by the user (**typically between 3-6**) depending on gradients in the emissivity pattern and rate of asymmetry.
		
7. **Define parameters to calculate the plasma composition**
	* **SXR detection limit** (float, default = 1500): defined as a minimum Te (eV) roughtly coincident with the photon energy of the filter function edge. This limit depends on the thickness of the Be-filter and on the quality of atomic data, so is machine dependent. (*A default is provided and usually works fine, but the user must have the possibility to choose a different radius or temperature limit*)
	* **Account for Zeff** (bool, default = True): calculate a low-Z impurity density to account for missing contributions to the Zeff measurement (*possible only if a Zeff measurement is available*)
	* **Cross-calibrate to VUV (default = True)**: use independent passive-spectroscopy impurity concentration measurement of Z0 to cross-calibrate the impurity density calculated using SXR. *For W this is currently implemented using KT7/3 quasi-continuum or spectral lines measurements*.
	* **Choose impurity elements**: 
		* Z0: main radiator (default = W)
		* Z1: time-evolving low-Z (default = Be)
		* Z2: if Z1 != Be, choose background constant Be concentration (*this element is currently hard-wired, but should be a choice of the user*)
		* Z3: second mid-/high-Z element (default = Ni) 
	* **Choose extrapolation methods** of impurity density Z0 beyond the SXR detection limit. All extrapolation methods (*choice of user*) proceed separately on the LFS- and HFS-midplane to preserve the measured asymmetry. The asymmetry factor λ_Z0 is re-calculated on the extrapolated profiles and used to estimate the 2D impurity density maps and all quantities that depend on them (e.g. total radiated power, Zeff LOS-integral, etc.).
		* **Constant concentration**: follow shape of electron density profile
		* **Extrapolate derivative**: use derivative at SXR detection limit to extrapolate LFS impurity density until a **rho_max** (user defined) where derivative -> 0; beyond rho_max use electron density shape to extrapolate up to the separatrix. The HFS impurity density is extrapolated using shape of electron density only
		* **Fit to KB5**: extrapolate Z0 impurity density using gaussian shape to fit experimental KB5 LOS-integrals. The fit parameteres  are the gaussian peak, height and width. Beyond the peak, the electron density shape is used up to the separatrix. (*The fit is a delicate point and requires more details...*)
